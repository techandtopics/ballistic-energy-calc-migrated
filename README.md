# ballistic-energy-calc-migrated-2

This app calculates the muzzle energy, momentum, and Taylor KO factor for a projectile based on the mass, velocity, and diameter. 
Muzzle energy is computed using the firearm industry's standard formula. Momentum is calculated using the standard formula. 
Taylor KO factor is a comparative measure of the knock-down power of a projectile. The formula was developed by John Taylor, 
an African game hunter, to compare the effectiveness of hunting cartridges.

The calculations in this app can be useful for hunting, reloading, target shooting, archery, and other activities involving projectiles.
